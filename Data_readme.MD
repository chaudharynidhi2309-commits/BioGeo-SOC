## Raw Data

**Do not modify files in `raw/` folder!** These should be read-only copies of original data.

### Soil Data (`raw/soil_data/`)
- Source: ISRIC SoilGrids v2.0 API
- Format: JSON responses
- Content: Soil Organic Carbon values (g/kg)

### Satellite Data (`raw/satellite/`)
- Source: Microsoft Planetary Computer
- Format: Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (optional local storage)
- Bands: B04 (Red), B08 (NIR)

## Processed Data

Files in `processed/` are generated by scripts and can be regenerated.

###  Values (`processed//`)
- Calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery
- Format: CSV or NetCDF
- Columns: date, location, ndvi_value
NDVI/EVI: Time-series vegetation trends extracted from raw imagery.

Features: The final CSV containing combined satellite indices and soil data.

Training: Final .npy or .csv files used directly by the Random Forest model.

### Features (`processed/features/`)
- Combined dataset for ML training
- Format: CSV
- Columns: ndvi, temperature, soil_carbon, etc.

### Training Data (`processed/training/`)
- Train/test splits
- Normalized features
- Format: CSV or pickle

## Data Not Included

Large files are excluded from Git. To obtain data:

1. **Soil data**: Run `python src/fetch_soil.py`
2. **Satellite data**: Run `python src/process_ndvi.py`
3. **Training data**: Run `python src/dataset.py`

## Size Guidelines

- Keep individual files under 100MB
- For larger datasets, use external storage
- Document download instructions in main README

## Data Privacy

⚠️ **Important:** 
- Do not commit sensitive or proprietary data
- Follow data usage agreements from providers
- Respect SoilGrids and Planetary Computer terms of service
